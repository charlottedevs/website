> _* Note on design decisions: The website is planned to evolve and the initial build will be static, while more dynamic content will be added later (see more below)
At least initially, dynamic apps and content will be “linked” off from the main static page*_

### Future Content Ideas

**Dynamic Apps**
* Mentor pairing
* Job seekers portfolios and gallery
* Volunteer / project management
* Blogs

**Other**
* Feedback / Suggestion submission form
* Pair Programming link-ups

### Contribution

1. Download file from github by using
  - `git clone https://github.com/cltdevs/static-website.git`
  - Pressing the clone or download button on the top right
2. Once downloaded and unzipped navigate into the folder
3. Install dependencies by being in the root folder and typing

   `npm i` or `yarn`

   \*Side Note\* - The app will probably work without this, but recommended gulp install:
   `npm i -g gulp`

4. Upon completion of dependencies installation run type the following into the terminal to start local server

   `npm start`

5. Send a pull request once you want to contribute
