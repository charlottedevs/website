# CJD Website

https://cltdevs.github.io/website/

After discussion, we came to the conclusion that *this is a Charlotte Junior Devs focused website*

### Purpose
  * Showcase who the group is and what we are about
  * Point the way to slack
  * Serve as a central hub to link current and future content

### Main Page Todo

1. - [x] The initial build will be a *single-page application* with future pages added once landing page is completed
2. - [x] Primary Content
     - [x] Slack link section
     - [x] Meetup events calendar (use meetup api)
	 - [ ] Change meetup call to vanillaJS
3. - [ ] User sections - Short text descriptions (see note below) about the types of people who would get value from the group
      > 1. Working Devs
      > 2. Job-seeking Devs
      > 3. Learning-path Devs
      > 4. Mentors
4. - [ ] Mission statement and purpose
5. - [ ] Sponsor attribution
6. - [ ] Links to current / future content
     - [ ] Github Dev Survival Guide
     - [ ] Code Cred

> _* Note on design decisions: The website is planned to evolve and the initial build will be static, while more dynamic content will be added later (see more below)
At least initially, dynamic apps and content will be “linked” off from the main static page*_

### Future Content Ideas

**Dynamic Apps**
* Mentor pairing
* Job seekers portfolios and gallery
* Volunteer / project management
* Blogs

**Other**
* Forum (DO & Discourse) - perma-storage content suggestion
* Feedback / Suggestion submission form
* Pair Programming link-ups
