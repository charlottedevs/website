> _* Note on design decisions: The website is planned to evolve and the initial build will be static, while more dynamic content will be added later (see more below)
At least initially, dynamic apps and content will be “linked” off from the main static page*_

### Future Content Ideas

**Dynamic Apps**
* Mentor pairing
* Job seekers portfolios and gallery
* Volunteer / project management
* Blogs

**Other**
* Feedback / Suggestion submission form
* Pair Programming link-ups
